# libhgeo
A library to organize geometry objects hierarchically.

This library tries to implement different hierarchical
data structures based on a common infrastructure.

Applications:
* Terrain
	- Different coordinate systems: Flat plane and Sphere
	- Terrain generation (libnoise or from file)
* KD-Tree
	- Support different construction algorithms
* BVH (TODO)
	+ TODO
